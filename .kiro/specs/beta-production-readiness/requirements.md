# Beta Production Readiness Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for preparing Tender Hub for beta testing in a production environment. Based on comprehensive technical audits conducted on November 1, 2025, the system demonstrates strong architecture and functionality but requires specific enhancements to meet production-grade standards with zero errors, warnings, or mock data.

## Glossary

- **Tender_Hub_System**: The complete web application including frontend, backend APIs, database, and email services
- **Beta_Environment**: Production-ready environment for limited user testing before full public release
- **Audit_Trail**: Comprehensive logging system that tracks all user actions and system events
- **Rate_Limiting**: Security mechanism that controls the frequency of requests to prevent abuse
- **Mock_Data**: Placeholder or test data that must be replaced with real production data
- **Health_Check**: Automated system monitoring that verifies all components are functioning correctly
- **Database_Migration**: Process of updating database schema and data structure
- **Email_Service**: Resend-based email delivery system for user communications
- **Authentication_System**: Better Auth implementation for user login and session management
- **Role_Based_Access**: Permission system with four tiers (owner, admin, manager, user)
