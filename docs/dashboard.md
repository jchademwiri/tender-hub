# Comprehensive User Dashboard Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive implementation plan for a fully functional user dashboard system with advanced user behavior analytics and activity tracking. The plan builds upon the existing Tender Hub platform, enhancing the current basic dashboard with sophisticated analytics, real-time metrics, and detailed user journey tracking.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with Better Auth authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
