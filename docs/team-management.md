# Team Management Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive implementation plan for team management functionality in the Tender Hub platform. The system supports three roles (admin, manager, user) with role-based access control for team operations.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with Better Auth authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Roles**: Three distinct roles (admin, manager, user) with different permissions

### Current Limitations
- Placeholder team management pages with no functionality
- No team member listing, invitation, or management features
- Missing role-based UI differences between admin and manager

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core API Infrastructure (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Shared Team API Endpoint
**Objective**: Create a unified `/api/team` endpoint that serves both admin and manager roles

**Features:**
- GET endpoint for listing all team members with pagination and filtering
- Role-based permission checks in API layer
- Support for search, sorting, and status filtering
- Audit logging for all team operations

**Implementation:**
- Extend existing `/api/team/route.ts` with full CRUD operations
- Add role-based middleware for operation permissions
- Implement pagination, search, and filtering logic
- Add comprehensive error handling and validation

#### 1.2 Database Schema Extensions
**Objective**: Ensure all necessary fields exist for team management

**Required Fields:**
- User status (active, suspended, pending)
- Role assignments (admin, manager, user)
- Invitation tracking (invitedBy, invitation status)
- Audit logging fields

### Phase 2: Frontend Components (Week 2-3)

#### 2.1 Shared Team Management Components
**Objective**: Create reusable components for team member management

**Components to Build:**
- `TeamMemberTable`: Data table with search, filter, and pagination
- `TeamMemberActions`: Action buttons based on user role
- `InviteMemberDialog`: Form for inviting new team members
- `EditMemberDialog`: Form for editing member details and roles
- `TeamAnalytics`: Basic team statistics and metrics

#### 2.2 Role-Based UI Implementation
**Objective**: Implement different UI experiences for admin vs manager roles

**Admin Features:**
- Full team member listing with all actions
- User deletion capability
- Complete role management
- Advanced filtering and bulk operations

**Manager Features:**
- Full team member listing (same data as admin)
- All actions except user deletion
- Role management (can promote to manager but not admin)
- Invitation and status management capabilities

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 4)

#### 3.1 Team Analytics and Reporting
**Objective**: Add insights into team composition and activity

**Features:**
- Team member statistics (active, suspended, pending)
- Role distribution charts
- Recent activity feed
- Export capabilities (CSV, PDF)

#### 3.2 Enhanced User Experience
**Objective**: Improve usability and performance

**Features:**
- Real-time updates for team changes
- Bulk operations for admins
- Advanced search and filtering
- Loading states and error handling
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Technical Architecture

### API Design

#### GET /api/team
```typescript
// Request
{
  page?: number;
  limit?: number;
  search?: string;
  status?: 'active' | 'suspended' | 'pending';
  role?: 'admin' | 'manager' | 'user';
  sortBy?: 'name' | 'email' | 'role' | 'status' | 'createdAt';
  sortOrder?: 'asc' | 'desc';
}

// Response
{
  members: TeamMember[];
  total: number;
  page: number;
  limit: number;
  totalPages: number;
}
```

#### POST /api/team/invite
```typescript
// Request
{
  email: string;
  name: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'manager' | 'user';
}

// Response
{
  success: boolean;
  member?: TeamMember;
  error?: string;
}
```

#### PUT /api/team/:id
```typescript
// Request
{
  name?: string;
  role?: 'admin' | 'manager' | 'user';
  status?: 'active' | 'suspended';
}

// Response
{
  success: boolean;
  member?: TeamMember;
  error?: string;
}
```

#### DELETE /api/team/:id (Admin Only)
```typescript
// Response
{
  success: boolean;
  error?: string;
}
```

### Database Schema

#### User Table Extensions
```sql
-- Existing fields: id, name, email, role, createdAt, updatedAt

ALTER TABLE "user" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "status" TEXT DEFAULT 'active';
ALTER TABLE "user" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "invitedBy" TEXT;
ALTER TABLE "user" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "suspendedAt" TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE "user" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "lastActiveAt" TIMESTAMP;
```

### Component Architecture

#### Shared Components Structure
```
src/components/team/
├── TeamMemberTable.tsx
├── TeamMemberRow.tsx
├── TeamMemberActions.tsx
├── InviteMemberDialog.tsx
├── EditMemberDialog.tsx
├── TeamFilters.tsx
├── TeamSearch.tsx
└── TeamPagination.tsx
```

#### Page-Specific Components
```
src/app/(roles)/admin/team/
└── page.tsx (uses shared components with admin permissions)

src/app/(roles)/manager/team/
└── page.tsx (uses shared components with manager permissions)
```

## Security Considerations

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Admin**: Full access to all team operations including deletion
- **Manager**: All operations except user deletion
- **User**: No team management access

### API Security
- Session-based authentication for all endpoints
- Role validation on each operation
- Input sanitization and validation
- Rate limiting for bulk operations
- Audit logging for all changes

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance for user data handling
- Secure deletion of user data
- Proper error messages without data leakage

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- API endpoint functionality
- Component rendering and interactions
- Permission validation logic
- Data transformation utilities

### Integration Tests
- Full user workflows (invite → accept → manage)
- Role-based access control
- Database operations and constraints

### E2E Tests
- Complete team management flows
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend Optimizations
- Virtual scrolling for large team lists
- Debounced search input
- Optimistic UI updates
- Lazy loading of dialogs and forms

### Backend Optimizations
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Pagination for large datasets
- Background processing for bulk operations

## Deployment Strategy

### Feature Flags
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- A/B testing for new UI components
- Rollback capability for issues

### Migration Strategy
- Database migrations with proper rollback scripts
- Backward compatibility during transition
- Data validation and integrity checks

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Page load times < 2 seconds
- API response times < 500ms
- Zero build errors or warnings
- 100% test coverage for critical paths

### Business Metrics

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Database Performance**: Large team queries could slow down
   - Mitigation: Proper indexing, pagination, caching

2. **Role Permission Complexity**: Complex permission logic could introduce bugs
   - Mitigation: Centralized permission service, comprehensive testing

3. **Real-time Updates**: Keeping UI in sync across multiple users
   - Mitigation: WebSocket integration or polling with optimistic updates

### Business Risks
1. **User Adoption**: Team may resist new management interface
   - Mitigation: User training, gradual rollout, feedback collection

2. **Security Concerns**: Team management involves sensitive user data
   - Mitigation: Security audit, compliance checks, minimal data exposure

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a solid foundation for comprehensive team management functionality. The shared API approach with role-based UI differences ensures maintainable code while providing appropriate access levels for different user roles.

The phased approach allows for incremental development and testing, reducing risk and ensuring quality. The focus on performance, security, and user experience will result in a robust team management system that scales with the platform's growth.
