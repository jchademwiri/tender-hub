## Authentication Implementation Plan Created

I've created a comprehensive authentication implementation plan that addresses your requirements for both authentication and user invitation systems. The plan is now available in your `docs/auth.md` file.

## 📋 **Plan Overview**

The plan provides a **7-week roadmap** with clear priorities:

### **Week 1-2: Core Invitation System** 🎯
- Complete missing invitation API endpoints
- Build invitation management dashboard
- Implement email templates and tracking
- Focus on getting users into the system

### **Week 3-4: User Management Interface** 👥
- Admin dashboard for user management
- Profile approval workflow for managers
- User activity tracking and analytics
- Essential administrative tools

### **Week 5: Security Enhancements** 🔒
- Two-factor authentication implementation
- Advanced rate limiting and monitoring
- Security audit and compliance features

### **Week 6-7: Production Preparation** 🚀
- Comprehensive testing strategy
- Documentation and training materials
- Production deployment readiness

## 🔍 **Key Features Included**

✅ **Complete Invitation Workflow** - From creation to acceptance tracking
✅ **Role-Based Access Control** - Admin, manager, user permissions
✅ **Security Best Practices** - GDPR compliance, audit logging, rate limiting
✅ **Production-Ready Architecture** - Scalable, maintainable, secure
✅ **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit, integration, and security testing

## 🎯 **What to Develop First**

The plan prioritizes the **invitation system** as the critical foundation since it's currently preventing users from joining your platform. This addresses the core business need of user onboarding.

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

Would you like me to:

1. **Start implementing Phase 1** (Core Invitation System)?
2. **Focus on a specific component** (like the invitation management UI)?
3. **Modify the plan** based on additional requirements?
4. **Begin with security setup** (email service, database indexes)?

The plan is designed to be flexible and can be adjusted based on your specific priorities and timeline requirements.
